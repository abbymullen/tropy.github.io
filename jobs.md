# We are hiring!

![](/assets/images/jobs.svg){: aria-hidden="true"}

<strong>We’re looking to hire a full-time, remote, contract developer</strong>
to join our team building open-source software for researchers. If you love the
AGPL and know JavaScript, then come work with us on Tropy, a beautiful Electron
app built with React, SQLite, and WebGL. Tropy is not out to disrupt industries,
transform markets, or change the world: it simply wants to be an elegant
solution to research entropy. To help us achieve this goal, you’ll work closely
with our lead developer and product designer, who will encourage you to focus on
the areas that interest you most, and help you to build new skills.
{: .lead}

## Requirements
* You’re good at JavaScript, especially with Electron, Node.js, or React
* You share our enthusiasm for open-source development

## Bonus
Depending on what part of Tropy you’ll be working on, these skills and interests
might help you hit the ground running:

* A good design sense and familiarity with CSS
* You value a good database schema, constraints and trigger
* You’ve hacked on or customized desktop apps before
* You’ve toyed with pixel shaders (or like computer graphics in general)
* You’re well-versed in the Babylonian confusion of AWS
* You love-to-hate linked data, RDF, or JSON-LD
* An interest in digital humanities, digital archives and preservation
* You speak more than one language

## About Us
The Tropy team is currently based in Vienna, Luxembourg, Philadelphia, and
Washington, DC; the project itself is hosted by the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for
History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/), the lab at George Mason University
which also created [Zotero](https://zotero.org) and [Omeka](https://omeka.org),
and the [Luxembourg Center for Contemporary and Digital
History](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/). We are a small, progressive team and we like
to get stuff done without any bureaucratic overhead; everyone around here adds
their own unique voice and you might learn unexpected things about the slurve,
labyrinths, 90s TV trivia, or 1.d4. The team highly anticipates meeting
occasionally in person once again, tracking art nouveau remains of Vienna or
discussing the Washington music scene over a slice of pizza, but you’ll
primarily be working remotely, communicating regularly with the rest of us and
Tropy users via online chat, forums, and on GitHub. We have a highly
collaborative yet asynchronous workflow, and you’ll be in control of your own
schedule.
